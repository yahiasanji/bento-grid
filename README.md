#GryffindorElites Mentor - Bento grid

![Design preview for the Bento grid coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

this challenge will help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this bento grid and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

### Expected behaviour

The two components in the left column on desktop are placed at the bottom on mobile. This is a good opportunity to practice your CSS Grid placement skills.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). 
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful,
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
